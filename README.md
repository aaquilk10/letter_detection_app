# Letter Detection App
The application processes data collected from a smartphone's accelerometer and tries to detect what letter the user wrote by hovering the smartphone in the air. SciPy is used to process the data and train the machine learning algorithm, and NumPy is used to store and manipulate the data. 
The application can only detect the first five letters of the English alphabet.
